# Merge test

This tests whether the script can appropriately merge clusters and propagate their merges.

## previous clustering
strain_01 and strain_02 separated by 4 SNPs.

## first clustering
strain_01 and strain_02 are merged by the appearance of strain_03. At the same time, a distinct strain_04 appears.

## second clustering
strain_05 merges the cluster of {strain_01, strain_02, strain_3} with the cluster of strain_04.
