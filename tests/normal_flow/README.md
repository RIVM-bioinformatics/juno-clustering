# Normal flow

This test mimics a normal flow.

## previous clustering
Two strains form two distinct clusters, strain_01 in cluster A014 and strain_02 in cluster C137.

## first iteration
strain_03 and strain_04 are added to cluster A014.

## second iteration
strain_05, strain_06 and strain_07 are added to cluster C137.
